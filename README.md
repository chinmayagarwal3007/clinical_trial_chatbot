# 🧪 Clinical Trial Matcher Chatbot

This is an AI-powered multi-modal chatbot that helps users find relevant clinical trials, get pharmaceutical info, and engage in small talk. It's built using:

- **Streamlit** – for the frontend UI  
- **LangGraph** – to manage multi-turn conversations and branching logic  
- **Gemini (Google)** – as the LLM  
- **FAISS** – as the vector store for fast semantic search over trial data
